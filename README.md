**🚕 Taxi Fare Prediction**


**📄 Project Overview:**

This project predicts taxi fares based on trip details using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key factors like distance, time, and location, the model helps estimate accurate fares.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies:**

Python: Data manipulation and modeling

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

**📊 Workflow:**

Data Exploration: Analyzed trip details and fare patterns

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, and engineered features

Modeling: Trained and evaluated regression models to predict fares

Evaluation: Used metrics like RMSE and R² to compare model performance

**🖥️ Key Features:**

Feature engineering to include trip distance, time, and pickup/drop-off coordinates

Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance

**📈 Results:**

Achieved a RMSE of 3.4 and an R² of 0.85 using Random Forest, outperforming other models.
